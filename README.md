Research Question: How effective is ARIMA for modelling stock prices, and what trends can be identified from its fitted components and how can these be compared to other machine learning models? 


This repository contains the code, analysis, and report for my MSc Data Science dissertation project at the University of Hertfordshire. The project investigates stock price forecasting using ARIMA, rolling ARIMA, and LSTM models, applied to FTSE 100 companies between 2015â€“2025.


The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of statistical and machine learning methods for financial time series forecasting.

Data: Daily closing prices of FTSE 100 stocks (GSK, BAE Systems, EasyJet)

Models: ARIMA, rolling ARIMA, and LSTM neural networks

Evaluation: RMSE, AIC, and Ljung-Box statistics

Key Finding: ARIMA provides robust short-term forecasts for stationary stocks, while LSTM can capture trends in non-stationary stocks but requires further optimisation.
